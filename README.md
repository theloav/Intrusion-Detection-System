# Intrusion Detection System using LSTM

📌 Overview
This Intrusion Detection System (IDS) leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture temporal patterns in network traffic, detect anomalies, and handle long-term dependencies. The model achieves a training accuracy of 99.98%, ensuring high reliability in identifying potential security threats.

🚀 Features
✅ LSTM-based detection: Captures sequential dependencies for accurate anomaly detection.
✅ High accuracy: Achieves 99.98% training accuracy with optimized hyperparameters.
✅ Anomaly detection: Identifies potential cyber threats in network traffic.
✅ Scalability: Can be integrated into real-time monitoring systems.
✅ Preprocessing pipeline: Cleans and transforms raw network data before training.
